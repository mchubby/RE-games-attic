 Foreword: Introduction to Entis GLS
=====================================
Entis Generalized Library Set (GLS) is a shareware middleware framework published by Leshade Entis,
and provides a set of interfaces and tools relying on Win32 and DirectX API calls, while exposing
a simpler interface. This allows to easily process assets for use in game engines, for instance.
Its website is hosted at Entis Laboratory:
 http://www.entis.jp/gls/

It encompasses several bricks, or 'layers':
- Entis Standard Library (ESL): defines a set of foundations classes handling several basic I/O and
  general-purpose functions.
- Entis Rasterized Image Superior Architecture (ERISA): handles multimedia file formats, notably
  .eri (bitmap image) and .mio (waveform sound). x86-optimized.
- Entis Graphic Library (EGL): handles 2D and 3D graphics rendering and transforms.
- GLS: ancillary functions, including the scripting engine

This game development framework ships with its own scripting language, Entis CotophaScript.
According to the reference guide, Cotopha stands for "Common Token Phantasy".

On the website, the downloads section offers an SDK archive containing tools for processing scripts.
As of the time of this writing, its name is "cotopha308f.lzh" (dated 2007/12/14). It also contains
an exhaustive reference manual which indicates what the script language is capable of.

Cotopha scripts (*.cos) are preprocessed, compiled, and linked using these tools.
This ecosystem translates scripts, which contain human-readable instructions, into machine-readable,
binary data. In many ways, it acts very much like how a C source code file is turned into an executable.


 I) About CotophaScript Executable image
=========================================
The result of compiling a plain text CotophaScript is a "CotophaScript Executable image" (*.csx).
Although it would technically be possible to compile plain script files (*.cos) at runtime, I have yet to
encounter those in commercial games; most of the time you will find them compiled form (*.csx),
along with other game assets.

.csx is a binary format. It is expected to be read and loaded into a Cotopha execution environment,
a virtual machine embedded into the game program.
The principle of the Cotopha VM is to be able to save and restore game state in a simple fashion,
that is to say flag variables, game progress, display status, etc. It was tailored for AVG-type games.

The Entis Laboratory website offers the Entis GLS SDK for download, "gls309a.lzh", which includes
insight into how these images look like. The relevant document here is "COTOPHA-func.doc".
It has a section of utmost interest titled "Cotopha Instruction Encoding" (詞葉命令エンコーディング).

Since we are looking for localizable items, we should look at how messages end up being displayed
on the game screen.


 I.1)  Basic types
-------------------

In CotophaScript, string literals are always 16-bit encoded Unicode, and we can safely assume it
to be UCS-2 Little Endian. Such literals are encoded as following:

	Format - String Literal
	#######################
	4 bytes - string length, in characters
  n*2 bytes - string data

Executable images may also contain a 'conststr' string section, which defines an array of string values.
It is possible to refer to these strings using a special size for string length:
	Format - String Reference
	#########################
	4 bytes - string special length = 0x80000000 (0x00 0x00 0x00 0x80)
  4 bytes - string index


CotophaScript allows defining variables with various types. These variables may end up in the
signature of functions, therefore it will be good to know a few basics about them.

	Table I.1.1 - CSVariableType values
	###################################

  numeric value | symbol
  --------------+--------------------------
	0             | csvtObject
	1             | csvtReference
	2             | csvtArray
	3             | csvtHash
	4             | csvtInteger
	5             | csvtReal
	6             | csvtString
	7             | csvtInteger64
	8             | csvtMax
	-1            | csvtInvalid

  
 I.2)  Instruction Encoding
----------------------------

CotophaScript defines possible values for instruction tokens in glsscript.h.
These are listed in Table I.2.1.

	Table I.2.1 - CSInstructionCode values
	######################################

  numeric value | symbol
  --------------+--------------------------
	0             | csicNew
	1             | csicFree
	2             | csicLoad
	3             | csicStore
	4             | csicEnter
	5             | csicLeave
	6             | csicJump
	7             | csicCJump
	8             | csicCall
	9             | csicReturn
	10            | csicElement
	11            | csicElementIndirect
	12            | csicOperate
	13            | csicUniOperate
	14            | csicCompare
	15            | csicMax

Text output is often handled by a custom function, because it's such a common task.
It varies depending on game software vendor. For instance, CUFF/CUBE/SPHERE use
  Talk(String voice, String name)
  TalkAdd(String voice, String name)
  Mess(String mess)
where voice (resource identifier) is blank when the protagonist speaks.
  
  
A function body is defined using the opcode 0x04.
  csicEnter = DEFINE_FUNCTION_BEGIN [known as "Create Namespace (function local area)"]
  {
    1 byte - instruction code = csicEnter (0x04)
    4+x bytes - string literal: function name
    4 bytes - argument count
    n times [
      1 byte - variable type (see Table I.1.1)
      4+x bytes - string literal: argument name
    ]
  }

The CotophaScript bytecode is designed is such a way that arguments to functions are transmitted via
a call stack. Arguments are "pushed" using opcode 0x02, then the function is called with opcode 0x08.
Arguments are pushed from the rightmost to the leftmost.
  csicLoad = PUSH_ARG_ON_STACK [known as "Load"]
  {
    1 byte - instruction code = csicLoad (0x02)
    1 byte - argument storage mode: irrelevant, leave as is
    1 byte - argument type - see Table I.1.1
    then, depending on argument type,
    {
      //csvtInteger = 0x04
      4 bytes - argument value
    }
    {
      //csvtString = 0x06
      4+x bytes - string literal: argument value
    }
  }

Calling a function is a 0x08 opcode.
  csicCall = CALL [known as "Function Call"]
  {
    1 byte - instruction code = csicCall (0x08)
    1 byte - function call convention: irrelevant, leave as is
    4 bytes - argument count
    4+x bytes - string literal: function name (some images use exclusively conststr refs)
  }
  csicFree = CALL_STACKCLEANUP [known as "Stack Release"]
  {
    1 byte - instruction code = csicFree (0x08)
  }


 II) .csx Header (0x60 bytes)
==============================
We have seen how translatable strings might be expressed in the bytecode. As already said, how they appear
is vendor-specific. Let us see how the executable image is structured, so we can reimage it after
performing modifications.

	8 bytes - 'Entis...' signature (0x45 0x6E 0x74 0x69 0x73 0x1A 0x00 0x00)
  4 bytes - unknown, 0xFFFFFFFF
  4 bytes - unknown, must be 0x00000000
  40 bytes - Entis Standard Library class name, zero right-padded. Is always
'Cotopha Image file' (0x43 0x6F 0x74 0x6F 0x70 0x68 0x61 0x20 0x49 0x6D 0x61 0x67 0x65 0x20 0x66 0x69 0x6C 0x65)
followed by twenty-two \x00 bytes
  4 bytes - executable image datastream length, excluding this header
	4 bytes - reserved. Always zero for future compatibility


 III) .csx sections
====================
The executable image consists of several sections. Each one has a specific identifier ("tag"), appears
once and is not aligned on a specific boundary.

Ordering:
 image
 function
 global
 data
 conststr (* not present in older versions of the SDK)
 linkinf

The generic structure for a section header goes like this:
  8 bytes - section name, right-padded with 0x20 bytes if shorter than 8 characters
  4 bytes - section datastream length, excluding this header
  4 bytes - reserved. Always zero for future compatibility


 III.1)  image section
-----------------------
The eight-byte section name field contains the values
	'image   ' (0x69 0x6D 0x61 0x67 0x65 0x20 0x20 0x20}

This section contains executable bytecode.
If the CotophaScript source (*.cos) has actual code (not definitions) at the global scope,
compiled instructions are placed in a special function "@Initialize" which is called at the very
beginning. Then if a main() function is defined, it is called afterwards.

What you will find most of the time in game script images, however, is a stub @Initialize() with
no code inside (csicEnter followed by csicReturn).


We have seen how functions are initiated in section I.2) Instruction Encoding.
